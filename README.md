# Design And Analysis of Algorithms
CS344: Rutgers' Fall 2016.

Professor: Farach-Colton.

This project transforms the theoretical aspects of Algorithms into Go code. 
Code is not thothroughly tested.

    4. Quick sort
    5. Merge sort
    6. Selection sort
2. Graph algorithms
    0. Data Structure 
        1. Adjacent matrix
